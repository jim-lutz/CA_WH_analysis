    Got the 2009 RECS survey because it sampled enough to indicate data from California 
    
    RECS 2015 has notes on 
    Using final weights (NWEIGHT) and replicate weights to calculate estimates and RSEs

for some queries when Eddie was preparing his presentation for the workshop.

    see https://schoolofdata.org/extracting-data-from-pdfs/

    Using the command line tabula extractor tool
    https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-extractor/wiki/Using-the-command-line-tabula-extractor-tool

    installed jq, https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/
    
    uses poppler-utils, apparently already have that one
    poppler-utils is already the newest version (0.62.0-2ubuntu2.5).
    
    tabula 1.0.2
    https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/releases/tag/v1.0.2

    pdftocsv.sh didn't work, but looks promising

    don't bother with tabula now. I'd already extracted the RASS fields.
    ../2009 RASS/Variables.xls    
    see also ../2009 RASS/2009_RASS_survey_with_variables.pdf
    
    for now load ../2009 RASS/Survdata.csv into .Rdata file
    
    looking at wt and the WH fuel type
    what are 99 & 97 responses?
    
    2009 CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL APPLIANCE SATURATION STUDY Volume 1: Methodology
    CHAPTER 4: Data Cleaning And Processing

    99, meaning not applicable
     truly missing responses were coded as 97
     
    Cleaning Water Heating Survey Responses
     
    See Table 4-11: Water Heating Fuel Data Cleaning
    check in number of samples matches in DT_RASS
    
    DT_RASS has more,
    check on SEASOCC

    loaded 2009RECS and weights, extracted CA data and saved in .Rdata file
    
    slab & attached garage by date?
    started for pie chart by type of housing unit,
    distracted by labeling TYPEHUQ
        
2019-02-02
    make sure matches HCD report    
    
    see house_type.R, HCD data from AHS data

    stacked cumulative area plots to show number of houses by type by year
        
2019-02-07
    add legend to cumulative area plots to show number of houses by type by year
    try adding hand crafted data to add a custom fill legend
    refactor data.table for sharing.
    
    stacked ribbons would probably be better, melt back to long first?
    https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_ribbon.html
    
    Single-Family Detached, number of attached garages by year
    stacked ribbon charts, 
    
    dcast long to wide (YEAREND One-car garage Two-car garage Three-or-more-car No Attached Garage)
    then
    # ymin and ymax for ribbons
    # Three-or-more-car
    #   3Gymin = 0
    #   3Gymax = nTYPEHUQ
    # Two-car garage
    #   2Gymin = ymax(Three-or-more-car)
    #   2Gymax = ymin + nTYPEHUQ
    # One-car garage
    #   1Gymin = ymax(Two-car garage)
    #   1Gymax = ymin + nTYPEHUQ
    # No Attached Garage
    #   0Gymin = ymax(One-car garage)
    #   0Gymax = ymin + nTYPEHUQ

    then melt back wide to long
    YEAREND GARAGETYPE YMIN YMAX

    looks like can do multiple ribbons with aes(ymin, ymax, fill=garage)
